            Flexible Addressing - Use Cases and Gap Analysis
    draft-jia-intarea-flexible-addressing-use-cases-gap-analysis-00

Abstract

   Along with the adoption of TCP/IP, an increasing number of emerging
   scenarios raise challenges due to the ossified address structure.  To
   still enable TCP/IP communication through and with networks using
   other protocols, a flexible address structure would be highly
   preferred for carrying semantically different addresses.  This
   document explores use-cases that may benefit from a flexible address
   structure, providing as well an analysis of existing gaps.

1.  Introduction

   As the unified protocol of the network layer, Internet Protocol (IP)
   constantly promotes the prosperity of the entire Internet.  With the
   success of TCP/IP protocol stack, IP is gradually replacing exclusive
   protocols and becomes the core protocol of the entire communication
   ecosystem.

   Along as the popularization of TCP/IP, an increasing number of
   scenarios would benefit from flexible address structure.  To fulfill
   the reachability, IP address is designed to hold the topology
   semantic and end-point identification semantic [RFC0791].
   While within limited domains ([RFC8799]), a multi-semantic address
   could be increasingly preferred in implementing complex actions and
   capabilities for particular scenarios.  Under such circumstances, a
   flexible address structure can unleash more possibilities in serving
   new scenarios.

   This document describes well-recognized scenarios that showcase the
   benefits of using a flexible address structure, and identifying the
   requirements of such flexible address structure.

2.  Flexibility: Potential Orientation

   Since a flexible address is expected be adaptive with different
   scenarios and routing abilities,
   potentially, orientations of a flexible address structure should
   include multiple semantics.  According to the definition of IP
   structure [RFC1180], cyberspace topology location serves as the only
   semantic of IP address.  While, in reality, for emerging use cases,
   several semantics are expected for reachability, e.g., contents
   [CONTENT-NET] or names [NDN].  To accommodate growing requirements of
   futuristic scenarios, address with multi-semantic embedding should
   compose the core of the flexibility.  Along with the dynamic semantic
   embedding, the length of the address may accordingly be adaptive and
   flexible.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Internet of Things (IoT)

   In many IoT scenarios, a simple, low-cost communication network is
   required, and there are limitations for network devices in
   computational power, memory, and energy availability.  In addition to
   [LR-WPAN], it can be seen that networks using link layer technologies
   such as Z-Wave, BLE [BLE], DECT_ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and PLC.  Generally,
   a group of IoT network devices form a constrained node network at the
   edge, and IoT terminals connect to these network devices for data
   transmission.  This type of networks and IoT devices in the network
   require as little computational power as possible, smaller memory
   requirements, better energy availability to reduce the total cost of
   ownership of the network.  Furthermore, in the context of industrial
   IoT, real-time requirements and scalability make IP technology not
   suitable as communication technology ([OCADO]).

   The end-to-end principle requires Internet protocols (e.g., IPv6
   [RFC8200]) to run on such constrained node networks, allowing IoT
   devices using multiple communication technologies to talk on the
   Internet.  Often, devices located on the edge of constrained networks
   act as gateway devices, usually performing header compression
   ([RFC4919]).  To ensure security and reliability, multiple gateways
   must be deployed.  IoT devices on the network can easily select one
   of gateways for traffic to pass through.

3.2.  Satellite Networks

   In the future, the space-based Internet will provide global Internet
   through satellite and ground station.  The low cost of satellite
   launch and the reduction of the cost of network equipment will
   promote the development of high-density satellite networks.  With the

   convergence of space-based networks and terrestrial networks, users
   can experience seamless broadband access.  Whether on cruise ships,
   flights, or cars, users will be able to switch data communication
   services over Wi-Fi, cellular, or satellite networks at any time.
   The network service provider will plan the transmission path of user
   traffic based on the network coverage, satellite orbit, route, and
   link load.  The advantage of long-distance transmission but shorter
   delay of space-based networks is fully used to provide high-quality
   Internet connections for users in areas not covered by terrestrial
   networks.

   Because the satellite constellation will continuously orbit around
   the hearth, the topology will continuously change over time (but
   conserving a regular pattern).  As such, there is a significant
   difference between the high dynamics of satellite network and the
   statics of terrestrial network topology.  The traditional satellite
   network cannot meet the preceding requirements through the networking
   of the dedicated station on the ground.

3.3.  Dynamic Service and Resource

   Network evolution will allow to integrate services and resources from
   various aspects such as life, production, and learning.  The basic
   data communication mode will be based on digitalized services and
   resources reorganized and divided into multiple data blocks on the
   network, where multiple copies of data blocks exist.

   Access to services and resources through URIs has been discussed by
   many researches, such as NDN [NDN] and ICN [RFC7476].  In practice,
   the dynamic service, resource management and access mechanisms
   integrating ID and address technologies will be more suited to user
   needs.  Service and resource providers will be able to establish
   online services and make available online resources through unified
   identifiers without additional planning of identifiers and locations
   for data and their replicas.  Users can access required the nearest
   services and resources in an on-demand fashion.  Furthermore, users
   can make a request based on the type of service and resource and get
   a response to the service or a copy of the data.

3.4.  Policy-based Traffic Control

   Policy-based traffic control is constantly far from flexible.  To
   restrict traffic for specific objects, e.g., devices, users, QoS
   requirements or group of them, the current solution is subnet
   partition.  Representative technique for subnet partition includes
   VLAN [RFC5517], VxLAN [RFC7348], or more evolved solution like
   Terastream [TERASTREAM].  However, such mechanism usually involves

Internet-Draft             Flexible Addressing              January 2021


   numerous manual configuration, and even small network changes may
   result in large manual efforts.

   According to the semantic of IP address forwarding, any inconvenience
   of traffic control stems from the decoupling of address semantic and
   policy objects.  Since address content only present topology location
   in IPv6, extra out-of-band effort is needed to partition network or
   recognize traffic from target objects ([TERASTREAM]).

   For semantic addresses with objects identifier encoded, policy-based
   traffic control could be almost automatic.  For every node forwarding
   traffic, object identity could be first extracted from both source
   and destination address once packets arrive.  Then by matching
   objects and policy-based rules, nodes on the path could trigger
   particular actions that dynamically assigned by administrators.  For
   examples, action permit, action deny, and action permit but low
   priority.  Such actions can also be applied for security restriction.

3.5.  Robust Trust and Security

   A flexible semantic could significantly help in constructing a trust
   and secure communication.  For instance, Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] embeds a truncated public key in the last
   57-bit of IPv6 address.  Even with a truncated key, authentication
   and security is greatly enhanced within a IP network via asymmetric
   cryptography and IPsec [RFC4301].  Similarly, Host Identity Protocol
   (HIP) [RFC7401] refers such methodology and constructs a enhanced
   TCP/IP stack.

   Within a flexible address structure, any secure-related key or
   certificate could be included in address structure without any
   information loss (i.e., as-is, without any truncation or operation as
   such).  Under such condition, connection provided by such address
   could be considered as absolute secure (assuming the cryptography
   involved is secure).  Even more, anti abuse mechanisms and/or DDoS
   protection mechanisms like the one under discussion in PEARG
   ([PEARG]) Research Group may leverage in address semantic to be more
   effective.

3.6.  Non IP Networks

   The SDN (Software Defined Networks) has, in recent years, highlighted
   how a majority of Internet traffic is better identified by flows,
   rather than packets.  Based on such observation, initiative has been
   taken on looking at alternate architectures that are flow-based,
   instead of packet-based as in the Internet architecture.  Rationale
   is that especially for Audio and Video flows it makes more sense to
   directly consider them not just as a stream of packets.

   The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) formed a
   Industry Specification Group (ISG) focusing on Non-IP Networking
   (NIN) [ETSI-NIN].  The aim is to develop and standardize a set of
   non-IP-based protocols that is supposed to provide better support for
   AV use-cases.

4.  Gap Analysis

   According to the capabilities for scenarios above, this section
   extracts basic requirements for a flexible address structure.  Points
   below details the basal requirements.

   o  Multi-Semantics: Since semantics are the core of network routing,
      multi-semantics compose the main capability of the flexible
      address.

   o  Variable Address Length: As for networks with constrained devices,
      short address becomes necessary for protocol adoption.  While on
      other hand, address space should be adequate enough to accommodate
      numerous devices.

   o  IPv6 Interoperability: Without global reachability, a flexible
      address would be the same as an exclusive protocol.  In other
      words, a flexible address should be valuable only it is inter-
      operable with IPv6.
